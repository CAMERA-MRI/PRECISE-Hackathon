## About SPARK:
The PRECISE-Hackathon is a collaborative one-week event designed to support the aims of the PRECISE symposium in transforming cancer diagnostics across Africa. The hackathon fosters a collaborative environment for developing innovative local solutions in cancer care. By building local capacity for precision cancer care, this hackathon aims to bring together students, experts, innovators, and stakeholders to create diagnostic imaging technologies and cancer care interventions based on artificial intelligence. Through innovation, collaboration, and capacity-building, this event will seed efforts towards advancing precision cancer care across the continent.
